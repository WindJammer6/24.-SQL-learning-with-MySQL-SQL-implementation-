I had a few school projects that required me to deal with databases, including an FAQ forum and a Telegram Chatbot to assist professors in teaching novice programmers.

I also have been wanting to learn SQL (or any of its implementations) for a while as the database aspect in Full-stack website developments. 

Initially, I wanted to learn SQLite as the SQL implementation, but I quickly learnt that it is serverless-based, which is not a typical SQL implementation, so instead I decided to learn MySQL as the SQL implementation.

Hence, the creation of this Github repository to document my learning journey of SQL.

Apparently while SQL is a programming language, it is different from other well known programming languages by being a fourth-generation programming language (4GL), while other well known programming languages (Python, Java, JavaScript, C++, etc.) are third-generation programming languages (3GL).

Apart from the '[SQL learn with My SQL (SQL implementation) code archives](https://github.com/WindJammer6/23.-SQL-learn-with-MySQL-SQL-implementation-/tree/main/SQL%20learn%20with%20My%20SQL%20(SQL%20implementation)%20code%20archives)' folder's sources where I learnt SQL with MySQL (SQL implementation), I also made reference from this popular 'CS50x 2024 - Lecture 7 - SQL' Youtube tutorial video (link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RCMYG8RUSE&t=2668s (CS50)) to get a general grasp on how SQL, Databases, Database Management Systems (DBMS) and SQL implementations (including MySQL) work, which helped tremondously in my understanding of SQL.

This folder contains all the MySQL (SQL implementation) files during my SQL programming language with MySQL (SQL implementation) learning journey segregated into 3 folders, '[2. MySQL (SQL implementation) basic syntax](https://github.com/WindJammer6/23.-SQL-learn-with-MySQL-SQL-implementation-/tree/main/SQL%20learn%20with%20My%20SQL%20(SQL%20implementation)%20code%20archives/2.%20MySQL%20(SQL%20implementation)%20basic%20syntax)', '[3.

MySQL (SQL implementation) integrated with Python (as backend) using PyMySQL (Python library)](https://github.com/WindJammer6/23.-SQL-learn-with-MySQL-SQL-implementation-/tree/main/SQL%20learn%20with%20My%20SQL%20(SQL%20implementation)%20code%20archives/4.%20MySQL%20(SQL%20implementation)%20integrated%20with%20Python%20(as%20backend)%20using%20PyMySQL%20(Python%20library))', organised based on the programming concept of each MySQL (SQL implementation) file. Most of the information from the first and second folders, '[2. MySQL (SQL implementation) basic syntax](https://github.com/WindJammer6/23.-SQL-learn-with-MySQL-SQL-implementation-/tree/main/SQL%20learn%20with%20My%20SQL%20(SQL%20implementation)%20code%20archives/2.%20MySQL%20(SQL%20implementation)%20basic%20syntax)' and '[3.

While in all 3 folders I split the respective lessons myself to the individual folders.

This folder also contains 1 text files, ['1. About_these_MySQL_(SQL_implentation)_tutorials.txt' text file](https://github.com/WindJammer6/23.-SQL-learn-with-MySQL-SQL-implementation-/blob/main/SQL%20learn%20with%20My%20SQL%20(SQL%20implementation)%20code%20archives/1.%20About_these_MySQL_(SQL_implentation)_tutorials.txt), 1 MySQL (SQL implementation) file, ['MySQL_(SQL_implementation)_query_that_creates_the_movies_relational_database_in_a_MySQL_(SQL_implementation)_server.sql' SQL file](https://github.com/WindJammer6/23.-SQL-learn-with-MySQL-SQL-implementation-/blob/main/SQL%20learn%20with%20My%20SQL%20(SQL%20implementation)%20code%20archives/MySQL_(SQL_implementation)_query_that_creates_the_movies_relational_database_in_a_MySQL_(SQL_implementation)_server.sql), and 1 Microsoft Excel file, ['movies_relational_database_visual_in_Microsoft_Excel.xlsx' Microsoft Excel file](https://github.com/WindJammer6/23.-SQL-learn-with-MySQL-SQL-implementation-/blob/main/SQL%20learn%20with%20My%20SQL%20(SQL%20implementation)%20code%20archives/movies_relational_database_visual_in_Microsoft_Excel.xlsx).

<br>

However, I did have some deviation for these tutorial folders from their sources:  

For deviation for the first and second tutorial folders from the Youtube playlist by Quentin Watt Tutorials, titled 'MySQL for Beginners':  
- In the Youtube playlist by Quentin Watt Tutorials, titled 'MySQL for Beginners' used MAMP and PHP as the
  IDE, but I used VScode instead (refer to the file 'Setting_up_MySQL_(SQL_implementation)_in_VScode.txt' for how to set 
  up MySQL with VScode).
- In the Youtube playlist by Quentin Watt Tutorials, titled 'MySQL for Beginners' used a pre-made Relational Database by 
  Quentin, but I used a 'moviesdb' Relational Database provided by codebasics in their Youtube video, titled 'SQL Tutorial 
  for Beginners | MySQL Tutorial' (link: https://youtu.be/Rm0xH2Vpfi0?si=QVr3mUdqUGLHN84R)

For deviation for the third tutorial folder from the Youtube videos by Tech with Tim, titled 'Python MySQL Tutorial - Setup & Basic Queries (w/ MySQL Connector)' and 'Python MySQL Tutorial - Creating Tables, Inserting & Selecting':  
- In these Youtube videos by Tech with Tim, titled 'Python MySQL Tutorial - Setup & Basic Queries (w/ MySQL Connector)' and 'Python MySQL Tutorial - Creating Tables, Inserting & Selecting' used 
  the 'mysql.connector' (Python library), but it dosen't work for my computer for some reason so I used the PyMySQL (Python library) instead, which works for my computer and is relatively 
  similar to the 'mysql.connector' (Python library) in functionality and syntax.
